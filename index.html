				<h1>Gorgons</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The Gorgons were three monsters in Greek mythology, daughters of Echidna and Typhon, the mother and
					father
					of all monsters respectively.
					Their names were Stheno, Euryale, and the most famous of them, Medusa. The Gorgons were usually depicted
					as
					having the face of a woman with snakes for hair.
					Often they were described as having golden wings, boar tusks, and the ability to turn anyone who looked
					at
					them into stone with their gaze.

				<p>Medusa was the most famous of the Gorgons. She was once a beautiful maiden, but was transformed into a
					monster as punishment by the goddess Athena.
					Unlike her sisters, Medusa was mortal, and she was eventually slain by the hero Perseus, who used her
					severed head as a weapon before giving it to
					Athena to place on her shield.</p>

				<p>Stheno was the eldest of the Gorgons and the only one who was immortal. She was known for her fierce
					temperament and her hatred for mortals. Unlike Medusa, she was never defeated and continued to live on,
					instilling fear in those who knew of her existence.</p>

				<h2>Euryale</h2>

				<p>Euryale was the youngest of the Gorgons and was known for her beauty and grace. She was also immortal,
					but
					like her sisters, she was eventually slain by Perseus. After her death, her head was placed on Athena's
					shield alongside Medusa's.</p>
